 	<h2>Lecture 03 - Anatomy of an html tag</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Tag Structure</h3>

    <p>Most html tags have an opening and closing tag and they surround content.</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>An example of a tag would be &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;.</li>
      <li>&lt;p&gt; content &lt;/p&gt;</li>
      <li>Technically speaking p is the element and &lt;p&gt; is the tag. But the two terms are used for both.</li>
      <li>No space is allowed right after the opening bracket. Space is allowed anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Some tags only have an opening tag, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;br&gt; (line break at the end of a line) and </li>
          <li>&lt;hr&gt; (horizontal rule such as the one you can see below this list)</li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
    </ul>

  </article>

<section id="section2">
  <h2>Lecture 04 - Basic HTML Document Structure</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Tag attributes</h3>
      <p>Example: &lt;tr id=&quot;tableHeadersId&quot;&gt;</p>
      <p>Every html element can have predefined attributes. Attributes are a pair of attribute name and attribute value. For example id attributes need to be unique. No other element can have the same id!</p>
     
      <ul>
      	<li>There must be a space after the element of the opening tag and its attributes.</li>
        <li>Attributes can only be assigned in the opening tag.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Value of attributes. It's not technically required to surround the attribute with double or single quotes, but you need to watch out for situations like these: &quot;alert('hi')&quot;. It doesn't matter which quote you start with, but the inner quotes must be closed first.</p>

  <h2>Lecture 05 - HTML Content Models</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Elements in prior HTML versions</h3>
    <p>The content model determines which elements are allowed to be nested inside with other element. Before HTML5 there were only block elements or inline elements. Now there are seven models.</p>

    <h3>Block level elements (similar to HTML5 category &quot;Flow Content&quot;)</h3>
    
    <ol>
  	 <li>begin on a new line by default</li>
  	 <li>may contain inline or other block-level elements</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Inline elements (similar to HTML5 category &quot;Phrasing Content&quot;)</h3>
    
      <ol>
  	   <li>render on the same line by default</li>
  	   <li>may only contain other inline elements</li>
      </ol>
    
    </article>

    <article>
      
      <h3>Div and Span elements</h3>
      
      <p>Div(block) and Span(inline) are the most generic elements. Div elements can contain Span elements, but not the other way around.</p>
      
      <p>You can have: &lt;div&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; but not &lt;span&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</p>

      <p>W3.org lists the seven types of element here: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html">Link.</a> </p>

<section id="section4">
  <h2>Lecture 06 - Heading Elements and some new HTML5 semantic elements</h2>
    <article> 
    <h3>Header for article</h3>
  <p>A semantic html element that tells you something about the content, e.g. it's importance. It helps readability and it MAY help search engines, but that is not for sure.</p>


  <h2>This is h2 (subheading)</h2>
  <h3>This is h3 (subheading)</h3>
  <h4>This is h4 (subheading)</h4>
  <h5>This is h5 (subheading)</h5>
  <h6>This is h6 (subheading)</h6>

  <p>These elements should only be used for creating a structure, not for styling. Just think of MS Word or Confluence.</p>


 	  <p>A section can have articles inside and an Article can have sections inside it. Sections and articles are block level codes. Therefore we might as well have div tags. However it is so much easier to read the code this way.</p>

  <h2>Lecture 07 - Lists</h2>
    <article> 
    <h3>Lists and Tables are not the same</h3>
    
    <p>See the document &quot;unordered lists before html&quot;</p>


    <ul>
      <li>ul ... unordered list (bullet points)</li>
      <li>ol ... ordered list (numbered)</li>
      <li>li ... list item</li>
      <li>You can indent list items like this:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;li&gt; This tag opens the list that contains a sub-list
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;ul&gt; This tag opens the indented list.
              <ul>
                <li>&lt;li&gt; &quot;Indented list item 1&quot;</li>
                <li>&lt;/li&gt; &quot;Indented list item 2&quot;</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;/ul&gt; This tag closes the indented list.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;/li&gt; This tag closes the part that contains an indented list.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to write a tag out as plain text in html</h3>
    
    <p>There are three characters that should ALWAYS be escaped: &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;</p>

    <p>How did I write &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;? With html entities! see <a href="https://mateam.net/html-escape-characters/">Awesome list of all html entities</a></p>

    <table>

        <tr id=&quot;tableHeadersId&quot;>
          <th>Sign</th>
          <th>can be expressed with the entity</th>
          <th>or by this code</th>

  <h2>Lecture 09 - Creating Links</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Making websites interactive</h3>

    <h4>External Links</h4>
      <p>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" title=" title helps screenreaders for visually impaired people!!, e.g. external link"&gt; name of external link, e.g. Google &lt;/a&gt;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The following link is an inline link and will lead to Google: <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></p>
      <p>You wanna use the target _blank tag so people who leave your website don't forget about it and continue somewhere else.</p>

    <h4>Internal Links</h4>
      <p>&lt;a href="same-directory.html" title="internal link"&gt; name of internal link, e.g. Same Directory &lt;div&gt; You can also insert a div tag inside the anchor tag. &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;/a&gt;</p>
      This link leads to a page within this directory. It's called notes02.html: <a href="notes02.html"><div> I haven't written much. It's just for the purpose of demonstrating that the link within the div tag will be rendered in the next line as opposed to the Google link above. However, because of the div-tag you cannot enter the a-tag inside a p-tag. Just leave the p-tag out.</div></a>
      <p>Use this, when you have a logo in a corner of your website and you want people to find it easy to click on it to get to get to the homepage.</p>
      <p>How is it possible to put a block-level element such as the div tag INSIDE an inline tag such as the a-tag? Because the a-tag is both a flow content (inline) and a phrasing content (block).</p>
      

    <h4>Link to some sections inside this page! :)</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1 - Lecture 03 - Anatomy of an html tag</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2 - Lecture 04 - Basic HTML Document Structure</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3 - Lecture 05 - HTML Content Models</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section4">Section 4 - Lecture 06 - Heading Elements and some new HTML5 semantic elements</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section5">Section 5 - Lecture 07 - Lists</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section10">Section 10 - Lecture 10</a></li>
    <li>create an anchor tag with &lt;a name=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;</li>
    <li>or a section id with &lt;section id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt; - the section name does not contain the pound sign #</li>
    <li>&lt;a href=&quot;#section1&quot;&gt; - only the link to that anchor contains a pound sign #</li>
    <li>Apart from being able to jump to other parts of your page, the fragment identifiers (section names and anchors) can also be used to share the link directly to that section. Since more and more websites are SPAs (single page applications), this is very useful.</li>

    ASIDE - Some information that relates to the main topic, i.e., related posts.

<h3>Self-closing tags (outdated)</h3>
In previous versions of html, esp. xhtml it was possible to use a shorthand notation to create a self-closing tag. A self-closing tag was a tag that will not contain any content, such as &lt;p/&gt; and was useful if you require a placeholder for content that you were planning to insert dynamically at a later point. However, in html5 this is not valid anymore.<br>
