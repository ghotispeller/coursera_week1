<h1> HTML Intro </h1>
  <p>The following infos are my notes from the coursera lecture <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/7zpSP/lecture-3-anatomy-of-an-html-tag">"Lecture 3: Anatomy of an HTML Tag".</a></p>

 	<h3>Anatomy of an html tag</h3>
  <article>
    <h3>Tag Structure</h3>

    <p>Most html tags have an opening and closing tag and they surround content.</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>An example of a tag would be "&lt;p&gt;".</li>
      <li>&lt;p&gt; content &lt;/p&gt;</li>
      <li>Technically speaking p is the element and &lt;p&gt; is the tag. But the two terms are used for both.</li>
      <li>No space is allowed right after the opening bracket. Space is allowed anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Some tags only have an opening tag, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;br&gt; (line break at the end of a line) and </li>
          <li>&lt;hr&gt; (horizontal rule such as the one you can see below this list)</li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
    </ul>

  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Tag attributes</h3>
      <p>Example: &lt;tr id="tableHeadersId"&gt;</p>
      <p>Every html element can have predefined attributes. Attributes are a pair of attribute name and attribute value. For example id attributes need to be unique. No other element can have the same id!</p>
     
      <ul>
      	<li>There must be a space after the element of the opening tag and its attributes.</li>
        <li>Attributes can only be assigned in the opening tag.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Value of attributes. It's not technically required to surround the attribute with double or single quotes, but you need to watch out for situations like these: "alert('hi')". It doesn't matter which quote you start with, but the inner quotes must be closed first.</p>

  <h3>How to write a tag out as plain text in html</h3>

    <p>How did I write "&lt;p&gt;"? With html entities!</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr id="tableHeadersId">
          <th>Sign</th>
          <th>can be expressed with the entity</th>
          <th>or the entity</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;</td>
          <td>&amp;lt;</td>
          <td>&amp;#060;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&gt;</td>
          <td>&amp;gt;</td>
          <td>&amp;#062;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&#8220;</td>
          <td>&amp;quot;</td>
          <td>&amp;#034;</td>
        </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>&amp;</td>
          <td>&amp;amp;</td>
          <td>&amp;#038;</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<h2>HTML Content Models</h2>

<section>
  
  <h3>Elements in prior HTML versions</h3>

  <article>

  <p>The content model determines which elements are allowed to be nested inside with other element. Before HTML5 there were only block elements or inline elements. Now there are seven models.</p>

  <h3>Block level elements (similar to HTML5 category "Flow Content")</h3>
  
  <ol>
	 <li>begin on a new line by default</li>
	 <li>may contain inline or other block-level elements</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Inline elements (similar to HTML5 category "Phrasing Content")</h3>
  
    <ol>
	   <li>render on the same line by default</li>
	   <li>may only contain other inline elements</li>
    </ol>
  
  </article>

  <article>
    
    <h3>Div and Span elements</h3>
    
    <p>Div(block) and Span(inline) are the most generic elements. Div elements can contain Span elements, but not the other way around.</p>
    
    <p>You can have: &lt;div&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; but not &lt;span&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</p>

    <p>W3.org lists the seven types of element here: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html">Link.</a> </p>

<h2>Heading Elements and some new HTML5 semantic elements</h2>

  <p>A semantic html element that tells you something about the content, e.g. it's importance. It helps readability and it MAY help search engines, but that is not for sure.</p>

  <h1>This is h2 (main heading)</h1>
  <h2>This is h3 (subheading)</h2>
  <h3>This is h3 (subheading)</h3>
  <h4>This is h4 (subheading)</h4>
  <h5>This is h5 (subheading)</h5>
  <h6>This is h6 (subheading)</h6>

  <p>These elements should only be used for creating a structure, not for styling. Just think of MS Word or Confluence.</p>


<section>
  <h2>Header for section</h2>
    <article> 
  	<h3>Header for article</h3>
 	  <p>A section can have articles inside and an Article can have sections inside it. Sections and articles are block level codes. Therefore we might as well have div tags. However it is so much easier to read the code this way.</p>

  <h2>Lecture 07 - Lists</h2>
    <article> 
    <h3>Lists and Tables are not the same</h3>
    
    <p>See the document "unordered lists before html"</p>


    <ul>
      <li>ul ... unordered list (bullet points)</li>
      <li>ol ... ordered list (numbered)</li>
      <li>li ... list item</li>
      <li>You can indent list items like this:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;li&gt; This tag opens the list that contains a sub-list
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;ul&gt; This tag opens the indented list.
              <ul>
                <li>&lt;li&gt; "Indented list item 1"</li>
                <li>&lt;/li&gt; "Indented list item 2"</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;/ul&gt; This tag closes the indented list.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;/li&gt; This tag closes the part that contains an indented list.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    ASIDE - Some information that relates to the main topic, i.e., related posts.

<h3>Self-closing tags (outdated)</h3>
In previous versions of html, esp. xhtml it was possible to use a shorthand notation to create a self-closing tag. A self-closing tag was a tag that will not contain any content, such as &lt;p/&gt; and was useful if you require a placeholder for content that you were planning to insert dynamically at a later point. However, in html5 this is not valid anymore.<br>
